Good Information to Know:
-------------------------

Tested: Update correctly calls from main.py -> bot.py -> TM.py, where bot.py will properly continue to call TM.py


Bugs Fixed:
-----------
 - Buy command in main.py correctly purchases given balance only when TM's hasFunds is true

 - Timer delay for update now delays both bot.py's update and TM.py's update

 - TM.py's update call to sell correctly sells, layers of incorrect method calls fixed


Things to Implement (In Order of Priority):
-------------------------------------------

DONE - A way to poll how much usd and btc I have, or how much has been invested in status, include how much lost

DONE - Create new TM when a previous TM is destroyed

DONE - Display a transaction log when desired 

DONE - Display whether a sell transaction gave a profit or a loss

After buying some BTC, then the bot sells, still unable to buy more BTC. Something wrong with balance?

Implement correct fee structure for okCoin

Create a command that allows the user to determine at what percent a TM is killed - "Safety?" currently seems to sell too quick?

Improve readability for log: Clean dates, etc, a bit?

How to use sentiment?
    emergency sell
    gauge volatility
    alter strategies
        very negative news -> buy
        when positive news appears -> stop buying

catch "ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', error(54, 'Connection reset by peer'))" in simulation

Quicker buys?

A clear screen cmd for the interface

Clean up methods for how text is colored in terminal

Better art.txt (looks pretty nifty now, could be smaller)

Real trading (last step)
